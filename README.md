
# DRONE SWARM

A simplified web-based system for managing and controlling a swarm of drones with real-time communication and coordination between multiple drones. 


## Features:
- <ins>**Manual Control of Drone Swarm:**</ins> The web interface allows users to manually control the drones with commands like takeoff,land,display.
- <ins>**Choreographed Drone Show:**</ins> Users can play a pre-configured video that triggers synchronized movements of the drones which generates the drone show.

## Technologies Used

- <ins>**Python:**</ins> Core programming language for developing drone control software.
- <ins>**DroneKit:**</ins> DroneKit provides an API specifically for controlling drones via Python, allowing developers to create applications that can control a drone's movement, retrieve telemetry, and monitor its state.
- <ins>**CherryPy:**</ins> CherryPy is a lightweight, object-oriented web framework for Python that simplifies the creation of RESTful web services and APIs. CherryPy supports real-time interaction between users and the backend, allowing users to issue commands and trigger synchronized actions.
- <ins>**ArduPilot:**</ins> A versatile, open-source autopilot system that supports a variety of vehicles, including drones. ArduPilot's simulation environment also aids in testing swarm behavior before deploying with actual hardware.
